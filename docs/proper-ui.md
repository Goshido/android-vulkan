## <a id="conclusion">Conclusion</a>

_LUT_ approach shows better performance compare to iterative _Newton_ approximation of two Bezier curves. Lossless and compressed _LUT_ show similar performance on real hardware. So it's decided to stick with _Lossless LUT_.

So:

- Swapchain format has been changed to `UNORM`
- It was added 3 types of primitives at pixel shader level: text, images and geometry
- _LUT_ is faster then _Newton_ approximation by 18.5%üü¢
- Uncompress _LUT_ is universal solution (_ASTC_ is not widely supported on _PC_)
