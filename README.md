# android-vulkan

Welcome to _android-vulkan_ source core repository. This project was started as personal hobby. Main purpose of this project is learning and implementing the most recent programming techniques for robust 3D game engines on the _Android_ mobile devices.

## Introduction

_android-vulkan_ is 3D engine framework. _android-vulkan_ is dedicated to _Vulkan API_ learning.

## Documentation

Usefull documentation is located [here](docs/documentation.md).

## Quick start instructions

Requirements:

* _Windows Vista_+
* _Android Studio 4.0.1_
* _Android Studio Gradle Plugin 4.0.1_

To begin, clone this repository onto your local drive.

Compile project shaders to _SPIR-V_ representation via _DirectX Shader Compiler_. See manual [here](docs/shader-compilation.md).

Next step is to compile project via _Android Studio IDE_ as usual.
